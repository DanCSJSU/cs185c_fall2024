**Sea Ice Melt Simulation on the Bering and Chukchi Sea Region:**


**Project Description:**

This project aims to investigate the impact of sea ice melt on local ocean temperatures and salinity.

**Project Science Question: How does the seasonal melting of sea ice affect ocean stratification in the Bering and Chukchi Sea region?**

To explore this, I will create a model that simulates the region's ocean dynamics for one year, running two different experiments; one with regular ice melt and one with
reduced ice melt. I will focus on the year 2016, because it is characterized by significant changes in the coverage of Arctic ice. I think that the model with the reduced ice
melt will show a higher surface salinity and warmer temperatures compared to the regular ice melt model thanks to decreased freshwater.

For the initial conditions, I will use data from the ECCO Version 5 Model for January 2017. I will construct boundary conditions from the same dataset and analyze the results
through a time series of temperature and salinity differences in key locations like the Bering Strait. Also, I will create visualizations to highlight temperature
and salinity changes between the two model scenarios.
